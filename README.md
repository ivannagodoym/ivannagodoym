- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @ivannagodoym
- I have a background in management, innovation, tech, and design, with five years of experience working in corporate innovation back in Chile, where I worked on developing human-centered solutions and managed innovation portfolios. I recently finished my second masterâ€™s degree in management and technology at the Technical University of Munich, where I specialized in computer engineering and innovation.
- In my free time, I enjoy being in the outdoors - running, hiking, or practicing yoga - to combine moving with my love for nature. I am passionate about technology and working with people to design and develop solutions that make an impact. I believe in the power of collaboration and enjoy working with teams from diverse backgrounds.

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in data analysis, machine learning, design, UX/UI & AI.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning C at the Ecole 42.
